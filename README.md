### 👋 Hello, I'm Yuliya Nazaranka - Junior Frontend Developer

<br>

💉 Medical Doctor 🌡️ | 💻 Aspiring Frontend Developer 🚀 | 📚 Lifelong Learner 🧠

<br>

#### About Me

👩‍⚕️ In 2019 I graduated from medical university and worked as a doctor for three years.🩺

<br>

🌍 After relocating to a new country, I decided to switch to programming. I believe my medical knowledge might be valuable for certain projects. I recently completed the EPAM UpskillMe Frontend Mentoring Program. 🚀

<br>

💻 Currently, I'm actively self-studying Node.js to expand my skill set and develop full-stack capabilities. In addition, I'm diving into AWS fundamentals at RS School to gain expertise in cloud computing and infrastructure management.

<br>

📚 I thrive on learning and am open to new challenges. I'm excited to expand my knowledge and contribute to innovative projects.
